# Magic

Magic exists in almost every Region of the universe, but it does not follow a single system. Different civilizations discovered and developed magic in their own ways, shaped by history, culture, and social structure. As a result, magic varies widely from one Region to another.

Most Regions rely on what are called *orthodox* magic systems. These are traditional systems passed down over generations and closely tied to religion, customs, and social rules. In such systems, magic is rarely separated from emotion, faith, or ritual. Casting a spell is usually treated as a spiritual or symbolic act, not a technical process.

## Orthodox Magic

In orthodox traditions, magical ability is linked to emotional strength, personal devotion, symbolic practices, and inherited knowledge. Rituals, prayers, sacred objects, and strict training systems control who may use magic and how. Power is believed to come from sincerity, passion, purity, or loyalty to tradition. Magicians are judged not only by skill, but also by how closely they follow accepted values.

Because of this, culture becomes the foundation of magic. Myths define what is possible. Institutions decide what is allowed. Social expectations limit who can advance. Someone raised outside the tradition may never gain access, no matter how talented they are. This creates stability, but it also resists change. Questioning tradition is often seen as dangerous, and innovation is slow.

Many orthodox systems rely heavily on emotion. Anger strengthens attack spells. Grief fuels curses. Love improves healing. Faith supports protection. These emotions do not create magical energy, but they help users focus and push past mental limits. In short bursts, this can be very powerful. Over time, however, it leads to instability. Practitioners become dependent on intense emotions, lose control, or suffer mental damage. Entire traditions have collapsed because of this.

Some systems place magic inside religious structures. Abilities are described as blessings, and spells are seen as gifts from higher powers. Failure is treated as moral weakness. Whether such powers truly exist is often less important than belief itself. Faith provides discipline and control, helping rulers and institutions maintain order. These systems are stable, but slow to change, and resistant to critical study.

Orthodox magic has survived for thousands of years and still dominates most Regions. It works but it has clear limits. Knowledge is scattered. Techniques are preserved as rituals instead of improved. Mistakes are explained through belief instead of investigation. Progress happens by accident rather than design.

In contrast, some civilizations developed a different approach called *Etherdynamics*.

## Etherdynamics

Etherdynamics treats magic as a functional interface between the mind and reality. Instead of relying on belief or emotion, it uses structured thought and internal systems. Spells are built from logic and intent. Most public rituals are symbolic performances, not real control systems. True magic is produced through precise interaction between the subconscious and external forces.

Under this system, the mind acts as a regulator. It organizes instructions, manages energy flow, stabilizes output, and corrects errors. Emotion does not power magic. It only affects quality. Fear causes interference. Anger reduces control. Confidence improves stability. Feelings shape performance, but they do not supply energy.

In Etherdynamic systems, curses are treated as information damage rather than supernatural punishment. They disrupt internal processes and feedback loops. Removing a curse is like debugging some code. Improving a spell is like optimization of that code.

Despite its advantages, Etherdynamics is rare. It requires strong self-awareness, abstract thinking, and technical understanding. There are no comforting traditions or emotional shortcuts. Many societies prefer orthodox systems because they are easier to teach, regulate, and justify.

Across the universe, orthodox and Etherdynamic systems often fight each other. Traditional practitioners see engineered magic as cold and unnatural. Etherdynamic users see tradition as inefficient and unreliable. Hybrid systems exist, but they are usually unstable.

No magical system is neutral. Each shapes the society that uses it. Orthodox magic supports hierarchy and tradition. Etherdynamics promotes specialization and technocracy. One concentrates authority while the other concentrates knowledge.

Etherdynamics is an attempt to replace belief with understanding.
