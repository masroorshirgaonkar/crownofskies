# Regions

The universe is divided into large-scale *Regions*, each developing independently over time. Each Region has its own culture, technology, and power structure.

A Region may contain only a few inhabited planets, or it may span entire galaxy clusters. Communication between Regions exists, but it is limited, distorted, and often controlled by political and economic interests. Information rarely travels freely.

Because of this, civilizations do not progress at the same speed.

Each Region follows its own path of development, shaped by history, resources, conflicts, and internal systems. As a result, Regions differ greatly in their economic structures, cultural values, and technological levels.

To describe these differences, humans use a classification system based on economic and technological development. Stages from Earth’s history loosely inspire this system. Regions are graded from Grade 0 to Grade IV and beyond.

*Grade 0* represents a primitive stage similar to the early *Stone Age*, where basic tools and fire have only recently been discovered. Societies at this level have little organized structure and rely mainly on survival-based communities.

*Grade I* corresponds to *pre-medieval* and *medieval-level* development. Technology is based on simple mechanical systems, often made from wood and basic metals. Economies rely on taxes, tribute, barter, and simple currencies such as gold and silver coins.

*Grade II* reflects the age of *Industrialization* and early consumer society. Technology includes basic automation, mass production, and long-distance communication. Economies become more complex, with organized labor, corporations, banking systems, loans, legal contracts, and, at higher levels, stock markets and large-scale investments.

*Grade III* Regions possess advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated technology. They are capable of interplanetary travel and maintain highly developed robotics and artificial systems. Their economies grow in complexity alongside their expanding influence, involving large networks of trade, research, and industrial production.

*Grade IV* and higher represent multi-planetary civilizations with extreme technological capabilities. Their economic systems operate on such massive scales that traditional currency becomes insufficient. Instead, they rely on large-scale barter agreements, shared ownership of assets, long-term alliances, and mutual-profit arrangements between major powers.

Trade networks, migration routes, research corridors, and smuggling paths connect different Regions. No Region exists in isolation for long.
