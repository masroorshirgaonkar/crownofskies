# Crown of Skies

*A living archive of an infinite universe.*

Welcome to the official repository of records, systems, histories, and recovered materials from across known space.

Crown of Skies is a long-form science-fantasy universe built around fragmented power, evolving systems, and shifting perspectives. This site is not arranged like a traditional novel. It is an archive of stories, documents, reports, experiments, and analyses that together form a living world. 

Some entries focus on characters and events. Others explain technology, magic, or political structures. Some are written from inside the universe, while others break it down from the outside. 

> Unity is temporary. Fragmentation is permanent. 

Every page here is part of the same universe, and every piece matters.
