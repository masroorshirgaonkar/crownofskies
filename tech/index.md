# Technology

Technology is as central to the universe of Crown of Skies as magic. In many Regions, it is the primary source of power, wealth, and political influence. While technological levels vary widely between civilizations, most advanced societies follow similar patterns of development, moving from basic tools to complex automated systems and, eventually, to weapons capable of deciding the future of entire Regions.

Unlike magic, which is often shaped by culture and belief, technology is driven by efficiency. Systems that work survive while the others are abandoned. Over time, this creates increasingly powerful and specialized technological structures.

## Personal and Daily-Use Technology
At the most basic level, technology supports everyday life.

These systems are designed for communication, health, transportation, education, and personal productivity. In developed Regions, most citizens rely on integrated devices that combine computing, networking, and biometric monitoring.

Common examples include personal communicators, smart interfaces, translation implants, portable medical scanners, adaptive clothing, and environmental regulators. Housing systems automatically manage temperature, air quality, and security. Transportation networks rely on automated traffic control and navigation assistance.

In advanced societies, daily-use technology is nearly invisible. Interfaces respond to voice, gesture, and neural signals. Information is constantly available. Many people interact with large data networks without being fully aware of their presence.

## Scientific and Industrial Systems
Above personal devices lie the systems that support civilization itself.

These include power generation facilities, resource extraction networks, manufacturing complexes, data centers, and large-scale logistics systems. Entire planets may be dedicated to mining, research, or industrial production.

Energy sources range from fusion reactors and fuel based generators to star harvesting structures and exotic matter generators. Matter is processed at molecular and atomic levels. Manufacturing often relies on automated fabrication units capable of producing complex machinery with minimal human oversight.

Scientific instruments in this category include deep-space observatories, Highly advanced scanners and multi-dimensional analysis platforms. These tools allow civilizations to study phenomena far beyond the limits of natural perception.

## Computational and Information Networks
Modern Regions depend heavily on information systems.

Planetary and interplanetary networks manage communication, finance, navigation, defense coordination, and research. Artificial intelligence systems assist with decision-making, prediction modeling, and large-scale administration.

Governments and corporations compete to control archives, surveillance systems, and encryption technologies. Information warfare is as important as physical conflict.

In highly advanced Regions, entire economies operate through automated contracts and algorithmic governance. Human oversight remains, but it is often indirect.

## Robotics and Autonomous Machines
As technology advances, physical labor and risk are increasingly transferred to machines.

Robotic systems range from simple maintenance units to fully autonomous combat platforms. Many are equipped with adaptive learning systems and self-repair.

Civilian robots handle construction, medical procedures, hazardous exploration, and disaster response. Industrial drones manage mining operations and orbital infrastructure. Security units patrol cities and borders.

Military-grade machines include autonomous fleets, infiltration units, and large-scale mechanized platforms. In some Regions, wars are fought almost entirely by machines, with humans acting only as commanders and analysts.

## Advanced Transportation and Spatial Engineering
High-level technology allows civilizations to reshape space itself.

Interstellar travel systems include faster-than-light drives, wormhole stabilizers, and dimensional gates. These networks determine trade routes and political influence.

Large-scale engineering projects include artificial habitats, planetary shields, orbital rings,  large stellar reflectors, and gravity-control machines. Some civilizations construct entire artificial worlds or modify natural ones.

Control over transportation infrastructure often matters more than military strength. Whoever controls movement controls commerce, migration, and war.

## Military Technology and Weapons
All advanced Regions develop weapons.

Standard military technology includes energy-based firearms, precision-guided missiles, electromagnetic cannons, stealth systems, and defensive shields. These weapons are designed for efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

More advanced systems integrate predictive targeting, battlefield-wide sensor networks, and semi-autonomous command structures. Battles become exercises in information processing as much as physical force.

At higher levels, warfare shifts toward strategic denial: disabling infrastructure, collapsing economies, and disrupting communication rather than simply destroying armies.

## Superweapons and Doomsday Systems
At the highest technological tier exist systems capable of destroying civilizations, planets, or entire Regions.

These include stellar destabilizers, planetary disassembly devices, reality-field disruptors, large-scale temporal interference systems, and self-replicating weapon networks.

Such weapons are rarely used openly. Their existence functions mainly as deterrence. Possession alone alters political balance.

Some civilizations maintain automated doomsday systems designed to activate if central authority collapses. Others hide their weapons inside civilian infrastructure or research facilities. Once deployed, these systems cannot be easily controlled.
