A comprehensive analysis of stability collapse, parasitic Nova behavior,
and the long-term consequences of uncontrolled Spirit Amplification.

## Overview

Broken Novas represent a critical failure in spirit-framework stability.
Once a Nova crosses its collapse threshold, recovery becomes nearly impossible.

## Causes

- Improper Ether routing
- Faulty anchor traits
- Psychological overload
- External interference

## Consequences

These entities exhibit:

- Autonomous behavior
- Host rejection
- Memory corruption
- Spatial instability

Understanding this phenomenon is essential for future containment protocols.
