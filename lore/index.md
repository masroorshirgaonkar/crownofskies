# Lore Archive

Welcome to the recorded history of the Crown of Skies universe.

In the world of Crown of Skies, magic, technology, and intelligence all develop separately and never merge into a single "true" form. Each region of space takes a different path, affected by resources, culture, history, and good luck.

In order to respect ancient customs and avoid science and technology, some civilisations stick to ritual magic. Others build their societies around total automation and artificial intelligence. Some people mix magic with engineering, while others completely reject both approaches.

This universe is not controlled by a single entity. There is no universal empire, no greatest ideology that wins. The universe continues to remain naturally unstable, competitive, and fragmented. Though power exists everywhere, it never stays focused in a single region for very long. Simple questions of good versus evil are rarely at the root of conflicts here. Instead, they focus on opposite ideologies, control, and survival. These conflicts are mainly about who gets to define reality and who has to live through it.
